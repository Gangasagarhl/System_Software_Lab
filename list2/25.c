};

msg_perm:

This is a structure of type ipc_perm that defines the permissions and ownership of the message queue (similar to file permissions).
The ipc_perm structure typically contains the following fields:
uid: User ID of the owner.
gid: Group ID of the owner.
mode: Permission bits (read/write permissions for the user, group, and others).
key: Key associated with the message queue.
seq: Sequence number.
msg_stime:

This is the time of the last successful msgsnd() call (when a message was sent to the queue). It is represented as a time_t type (epoch timestamp).
msg_rtime:

This is the time of the last successful msgrcv() call (when a message was received from the queue). It is also a time_t type.
msg_ctime:

This represents the time of the last change to the message queue, such as when the permissions or ownership were modified. It is updated by calls like msgctl().
msg_cbytes:

This field holds the current number of bytes of messages stored in the queue (i.e., the total size of messages waiting in the queue).
msg_qnum:

This is the number of messages currently in the queue.
msg_qbytes:

This specifies the maximum number of bytes allowed in the message queue (the queueâ€™s capacity in bytes).
msg_lspid:

This stores the process ID (PID) of the last process that sent a message to the queue.
msg_lrpid:

This stores the process ID (PID) of the last process that received a message from the queue.
